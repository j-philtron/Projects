A secondary question we want to answer is whether there more users that post questions than answers.\n\nWe will access information from both the `posts_questions` and `posts_answers` tables. We will group by `user_id` defined as the `owner_user_id` column from the `posts_answers` table, and count the `number_of_answers` given by each user. We will join the `posts_questions` table on the `id` column to the `parent_id` column from `posts_answers`, and count the `number_of_questions` given by each user.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"question_numbers_query = \"\"\"\n                SELECT owner_user_id AS user_id,\n                    COUNT(1) AS number_of_questions\n                FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`\n                WHERE creation_date >= '2021-01-01'\n                    AND creation_date < '2021-02-01'\n                GROUP BY owner_user_id\n                ORDER BY number_of_questions DESC\n                \"\"\"\n\n# Set up the query, with a limit on the total memory accessed\nsafe_config = bigquery.QueryJobConfig(maximum_bytes_billed=10**10)\nquestion_numbers_query_job = client.query(question_numbers_query, job_config=safe_config) # Your code goes here\n\n# API request - run the query, and return a pandas DataFrame\nquestion_numbers_results = question_numbers_query_job.to_dataframe() # Your code goes here\n\n# Preview results\nprint(question_numbers_results.head())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-03T21:48:23.302831Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-03T21:48:23.303256Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-03T21:48:27.460494Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-03T21:48:23.303189Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-03T21:48:27.459643Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We see that a \"person\" with `user_id` NaN posted the most questions!
